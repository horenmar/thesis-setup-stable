1) Download the wllvm utility (in submodules)
	See https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm for usage details.

1b) Apply patch to force turning on the supported sanitizers.
	Its in file sanitizer.patch
        patch < sanitizer.patch should be enough

1c) Add wllvm to path

2) Add libkleeRuntest.so to linker's path.
        Its in klee/_build/Release+Asserts/lib/
        This means either putting it in say /usr/local/lib/
        or setting LIBRARY_PATH or up the makefile with proper path
