1)  Download LLVM-GCC for LLVM2.9 binaries from here 
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.9
        http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/llvm-gcc4.2-2.9-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2

1b) Unpack and add them to PATH. <-- THIS IS IMPORTANT
        If LLVM configure doesn't pick it up, it doesn't error out, it just
        causes lots of problems later.

2)  Download and build LLVM2.9 from here
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.9
        http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/llvm-2.9.tgz

        ./configure --enable-optimized --enable-assertions

2b) If compilation fails because of missing "lseek64", use included patch file.
    This is needed because that source file relies on transitive includes and
    current glibc is different.

        patch -p1 < llvm-2.9-lseek64.patch

3)  Download and build STP (in submodules)
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DENABLE_PYTHON_INTERFACE:BOOL=OFF
        make

<This project doesn't use uclibc and POSIX, so they are skipped.>

4)  Download and build KLEE (in submodules)
        ./configure --with-stp=<full/path/to/stp> --with-llvm=<full/path/to/llvm>
        make DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0 ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=1 ENABLE_SHARED=0

4b) Optionally run KLEE test suite
        make check
        make unittests
