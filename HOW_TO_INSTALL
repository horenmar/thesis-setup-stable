1)  Download LLVM-GCC for LLVM2.9 binaries from here 
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.9
        http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/llvm-gcc4.2-2.9-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2

1b) Unpack and add them to PATH.
        This isn't strictly necessary, but since using KLEE necessitates
        using LLVM IR compiler, it will save some time.

2)  Download and build LLVM2.9 from here
        http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.9
        http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/llvm-2.9.tgz

        ./configure --enable-optimized --enable-assertions

2b) If compilation fails because of missing "lseek64", use included patch file.
    This is needed because that source file relies on transitive includes and
    current glibc is different.

        patch -p1 < llvm-2.9-lseek64.patch

3)  Download and build STP (in submodules)
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DENABLE_PYTHON_INTERFACE:BOOL=OFF
        make

<This project doesn't use uclibc and POSIX, so they are skipped.>

4)  Download and build KLEE (in submodules)
        ./configure --with-stp=<full/path/to/stp> \
        --with-llvm=<full/path/to/llvm> \
        --with-llvmgccdir=<full/path/to/llvm-gcc>
        make DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0 ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=1 ENABLE_SHARED=0

4b) Optionally run KLEE test suite
        make check
        make unittests
