The contents of the outputs.zip file and outputs folder are identical, but if
your OS has trouble dealing with large amount of small files, you should copy

The folders inside outputs/ are named according to the run they were produced
by. For more explanations and details see Appendix D of the thesis. The .log
files inside these folders are a calltrace from KLEE's run in textual form.
